# Apost Environment

Apost Environment is the first open-source exploit environment built for Exploit developers who want more control over their exploit development process.

This environment was created with flexibility in mind, allowing developers to tailor the functions for specific use cases. As the first of its kind, Apost Environment helps developers explore new possibilities in Roblox exploiting by making it easier to work on exploits without needing extra, external support.

> [!NOTE]  
> Certain functions such as `hookfunction`, `hookmetatable` and the `debug` library may not work based on your executor level!

## Key Features

### No External Backend Needed
A major advantage of Apost Environment is that it doesn’t rely on any external backend, such as bridges or external APIs, to function. This means that everything happens **locally**, right on your machine. This makes the environment easier to set up and use, and it also offers a higher degree of privacy and control. You won’t need to send data back and forth to servers or depend on third-party tools to get your exploit to work—everything you need is built into Apost.

### Completely Open-Source
Apost Environment is fully open-source, meaning anyone can access the code, make changes, or even contribute to the project. This helps create a collaborative environment where developers can share ideas and improve the exploit functions together. If you have an idea to make Apost better, you can directly contribute to the repository.

### Customizable for Developers
Every function in Apost Environment is designed with flexibility in mind. Developers have the ability to modify and customize the provided functions to suit their specific exploit needs. Whether you're looking to add more features or tweak the behavior of existing ones, the open-source nature of Apost gives you full access to make the necessary changes.
